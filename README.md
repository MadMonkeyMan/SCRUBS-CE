# SCRUBS-CE
Fork of the SCRUBS Community Edition originally offered by SummitCloud under the GPLv2 License. Their original website is here: http://www.summitcloud.com/ . I have tried to reach them on several occations regarding SSRS 2016 but I am not able to. It looks like they expanded drastically on what Microsoft did in the SQL Server Smples set for 2005 and 2008 in regards to an ETL process for pulling data out of the SSRS ExecutionLog3 view.

Codeplex is going away and I use this everywhere, so I wanted to create an up to date version that will work. Any community help is appreciated :)
